Most courses in universities and colleges today are compulsory, however, there are a few courses that are optional. Despite its small percentage, optional courses have given rise to the question whether college students should choose their courses at their own wills.
As far as I am concerned, I think college students should be encouraged to choose courses they are interested in. As the saying goes, "Interest is the best teacher". Students will certainly study more efficiently , they may become more active in the study concerned.
